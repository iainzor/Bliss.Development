	The Docs module provides a way of compiling all available documentation into a single place.
	All registered modules can provide their own documentation simply by creating a <code>/docs</code>
	directory and filling it with HTML documents.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
	Each HTML file within the <code>/docs</code> directory acts as its own page; this also includes
	all sub-directories.  This directory itself can be treated as its own set of web pages, including any type of
	<a href="./docs/assets">asset</a>.
</p>

<p>
	In order to access the module's documentation, navigate to <code>/docs/[module-name]</code>.  The navigation for the 
	module is automatically generated based on the directory structure.
